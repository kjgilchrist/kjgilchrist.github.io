        <h3>Project Deliverables & Point Value:</h3>
        <p>Here is a list of all of my deliverables for this project with a grand total of <b>123 points</b>. However, I do not expect to get the full points in each category. By the way, they are all linked here!</p>
        <ol>
          <li><a href="index.html">Web Portfolio</a> (30pts+)
            <p>For this portfolio, I started with a template. I very quickly re-did that entire template from scratch and took the slideshow from Neill (thank you). The content is still being developed, but the core skeleton is there! I estimate that I've put in over 100 hours into this and it is nowhere near complete. I've focused on making it responsive and modular. I am currently working on design, content and adding more interactive elements.</p>
            <p class="tools">[GitHub, Atom > HTML, CSS, JS]</p>
          </li>
          <li><a href="#prosem-roadmap">Program Roadmap</a>
            <ul>
              <li>Focus Elective Plan (2pts)</li>
              <li>Priority Interests Ladder (2-5pts)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Proposed based on the concept mention in class, I've created my “ladder”, prioritizing my interests in this program. This was an exercise to help further guide my roadmap.</p>
            <p class="tools">[Illustrator]</p>
          </li>
          <li><a href="#prosem-final-write">Final Write-Up</a> (15pts)</li>
          <li><a href="#prosem-self-brand">Self-Branding</a>
            <ul>
              <li>Resume/CV (5pts)</li>
              <li>Custom Letterhead (2pts)</li>
              <li>Cover Letter Template (2-5pts)</li>
              <li>Networking Email Template (2pts)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I put all of this under "Self-Branding" because it is contains a consistent template (created by myself). That way there is a level of consistency with my communications with potential employers.</p>
            <p class="tools">[InDesign, Illustrator]</p>
          </li>
          <li><a href="#prosem-jobs">Job Postings</a> (10pts)</li>
          <li><a href="#prosem-curate-resume">Curation of Resume/CV</a> (2pts)
            <p>A proposed part of my project, I wanted to further my self-branding dive and find consistent ways to curate my resume content based on job position. Future Note: I want to make this an interactive resume on my portfolio that has this curation as a built-in funcitonality.</p>
          </li>
          <li><a href="#prosem-thank-you">Generative Code Thank Yous</a> (2-5pts)
            <p>I had fun making something creative and unique as a Thank You. I used the previous self-branding template to help maintain consistency.</p>
            <p class="tools">[Atom > JS]</p>
          </li>
          <li><a href="">LinkedIn Update</a> (2-5pts)</li>
          <li><a href="#prosem-articles">Blog/Articles</a> (10pts)
            <p>I proposed an alternative to the Blog posts, where I would research topics that I am interested in and are relevant to my passions linked with design. Each includes a discussion on how it could be applied to educational design. Arguably similar to a blog post, but with the additional requirement of researching and listing my sources. I believe I fall somewhere in the middle...</p>
          </li>
          <li><a href="#prosem-book">Book of Choice</a> (10pts)</li>
          <li><a href="#prosem-self-care">Self-Care Inventory & Plan</a> (10pts)
            <p>I have adjusted the original design of this item to fit my own needs!</p>
          </li>
          <li>Extra Activities: Skills Developed (2-5pts)
            <p>I argue that the creation of this portfolio, along with many of the deliverables, has significantly impacted my "Toolbox". My technical skills in many tools (some listed with each item) have grown exponentially over the course of this project. For that reason alone, I am including this deliverable.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>What career goal(s) did you have coming into the course? How, if at all has that changed? Which speakers influenced you and how?
            <p>My initial career goal at the beginning of this course was the path toward becoming a UI/UX Lead. This would involve starting as a UX Designer and acquiring expertise in the industry. Occasionally, people can obtain a management position without this experience; however, the majority of positions I've seen, as well as my personal goals, align with at least 3-5 years of experience working within a team before managing one.</p>
            <p>Throughout this course, we've heard from many speakers in many different fields and there were a few that really caught my attention. The first was Justin Gitlin, a creative coder and musician (to name only two of his many titles). Intially, I didn't realize that such a job existed and my dive into coding in his class has made me gain significant interest in this topic. However, it appears that much of that work would be contractual and I would be working as an independent artist. That would be a challenge for me to start directly after this program, but not impossible.</p>
            <p>The next speaker that I really enjoyed was Jillian Berger. I wasn't particular interested in becoming a UX Researcher (although, working with people and empathizing is something I do enjoy). However, her method of managing and creating a team was very helpful. If I were to manage a team, I would want her as a resource when I first start out.</p>
            <p>After that, there was a long pause. I heard many different perspectives and stories, which were helpful in forming my own opinions on where and what my work day might look like.</p>
            <p>The next speaker that I really related to was Megan Friesth. Her discovery of a position that allowed her to cover all of her passions was inspiring. It was especially motivating to hear from someone who is passionate about education and who is using her creative tools to make that reality. If I could find a similar role, even within a more direct educational company, that would be ideal. Leading a team within that realm could be an ultimate goal.</p>
            <p>The final speaker that I connected with was Billy Griffin. Not only did I agree with his "growth mindset" and positive attitude toward change (and risk), but I also really enjoyed hearing his story of finding the position he is in. It was a long and twisting journey, and I fully expect mine to be similar. I don't expect that I will fall into the perfect position right away, but I do hope that it doesn't take too long.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, I believe that my career goals have branched to the possibility of creative coding and educational design (which would likely fall into the category of UX). Ideally, I would like to combine all of them, like Megan, and find a position that allows me to overlap education, creative coding and design. Eventually, building and managing a team under that umbrella!</p>
          </li>
          <li>What has this course helped you recognize that you’ll need to do to prepare for this career and how specifically will you need to do that (e.g. raise capital, make a business plan, add to your education, etc.)?
            <p>There are three things that I've realized (or that the course has reinforced): 1) I need to build up my technical "toolbox" with relevant tools for future careers, 2) I need to build up a relevant portfolio to showcase work that I <em>want</em> to do, and 3) if I am unable to find a position that fits all of my passions, I can paved my own path - I need business knowledge and experience. I do believe that the opprtunity to do all of these things lies within the program and I just need to pursue them as fervently as possible.</p>
          </li>
          <li>What kind of environment do you see yourself fitting into best and why?
            <p>I am strongly drawn toward an smaller, more intimate environment. Whether it is a startup, a small business, or a business I begin on my own, I think that I would feel "silo'd" or otherwise unable to maintain my core requirements: keeping a broad range of skills, continuously learning new skills, working on a variety of projects, and having the flexibility to change hats. I am a bit chaotic in how I work, jumping between tasks often, and I don't believe that my style of work or values would easily fit within a larger company setting.</p>
          </li>
          <li>What have you done this semester as a result of this course to advance your professional development that you hadn’t been doing prior?</li>
          <li>What, if any, feedback do you have for us on the class? Biggest takeaways from the course, etc.
            <p>Feedback will be given in the submission of this Final Project on Canvas, because I believe in the importance privacy!</p>

      <div class="content four-col">
        <p>Identify job postings for at least 5 jobs similar to the ones you’d be applying for. Please make this a mix of jobs you might apply for in the near future (right out of school) versus those you’d aspirationally apply for later in your career (think 5 or 10 years for now). An example of this is that you may look for postings for a junior producer now, a senior producer in 5 years, and a creative director in 10. What qualifications or skills are you missing? How can you get those? What might you do to set yourself apart and what would your plan to do that be? As you pull job postings, also keep in mind what kind of company you want to work for and how that may change over time (e.g. start out somewhere big, move into something small, etc.). Please reference or link to any articles you’ve read on the future of the creative freelance market. How are you preparing for this?</p>
