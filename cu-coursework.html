        <h3>Project Deliverables & Point Value:</h3>
        <ol class="descriptive">
          <p>Here is a list of all of my deliverables for this project with a grand total of <b>113 points</b>. By the way, they are all linked here!</p>
          <li><a href="index.html">Web Portfolio</a> (30pts+)</li>
            <p>For this portfolio, I started with a template. I very quickly re-did that entire template from scratch and took the slideshow from Neill (thank you). The content is still being developed, but the core skeleton is there! I estimate that I've put in over 100 hours into this. I've focused on making it responsive and modular. I am currently working on adding more interactive elements.</p>
            <p class="tools">[GitHub, Atom > HTML, CSS, JS]</p>
          <li><a href="#prosem-roadmap">Program Roadmap</a>
            <ul>
              <li>Priority Interests Ladder (2-5pts)</li>
              <li>Focus Elective Roadmap (2pts)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Proposed based on the concept mention in class, I've created my “ladder”, prioritizing my interests in this program. This was an exercise to help further guide my roadmap.</p>
            <p class="tools">[Illustrator]</p>
          </li>
          <li><a href="#prosem-final-write">Final Write-Up</a> (15pts)</li>
          <li><a href="#prosem-self-brand">Self-Branding</a></li>
            <ul>
              <li>Resume/CV (5pts)</li>
              <li>Custom Letterhead (2pts)</li>
              <li>Cover Letter Template (2-5pts)</li>
              <li>Networking Email Template (2pts)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I put all of this under "Self-Branding" because it is contains a consistent template (created by myself). That way there is a level of consistency with my communications with potential employers.</p>
            <p class="tools">[InDesign, Illustrator]</p>
          <li><a href="#prosem-curate-resume">Curation of Resume/CV (2pts)</a></li>
            <p>A proposed part of my project, I wanted to further my self-branding dive and find consistent ways to curate my resume content based on job position. Future Note: I want to make this an interactive resume on my portfolio that has this curation as a built-in funcitonality.</p>
          <li><a href="#prosem-thank-you">Generative Code Thank Yous (2-5pts)</a></li>
            <p>I had fun making something creative and unique as a Thank You. I used the previous self-branding template to help maintain consistency.</p>
            <p class="tools">[Atom > JS]</p>
          <li><a href="">LinkedIn Update (2-5pts)</a></li>
          <li><a href="#prosem-articles">Blog/Articles (10pts)</a></li>
            <p>I proposed an alternative to the Blog posts, where I would research topics that I am interested in and are relevant to my passions linked with design. Each includes a discussion on how it could be applied to educational design. Arguably similar to a blog post, but with the additional requirement of researching and listing my sources.</p>
          <li><a href="#prosem-book">Book (10pts)</a></li>
          <li><a href="#prosem-self-care">Self-Care Inventory & Plan (10pts)</a></li>
            <p>I have adjusted the original design of this item to fit my own needs!</p>
          <li>Extra Activities: Skills Developed (2-5pts)</li>
            <p>I argue that the creation of this portfolio, along with many of the deliverables, has significantly impacted my "Toolbox". My technical skills in many tools (some listed with each item) have grown exponentially over the course of this project. For that reason alone, I am including this deliverable.</p>

        <p>This document should be a reflection processing the course as a whole and the impact it had on you.<br>
          In class, we referred to this as the “zoom out, overview”.<br>
          We’d like you to address considerations such as:<br>
          What career goal(s) did you have coming into the course (think back to your first assignment on your dream career)? How, if at all has that changed? Please specifically address if you’ve changed course and are considering something new (and why), or if the course helped reinforce your goals (and how)? What has this course helped you recognize that you’ll need to do to prepare for this career and how specifically will you need to do that (e.g. raise capital, make a business plan, add to your education, etc.) Which speakers impacted you the most and how? (What specifically did they offer you in terms of advice or what did they say that resonated most?) How did our studio tours help increase your awareness of what kind of environment you’d like to work in? (Specifically, what kind of environment do you see yourself fitting into best and why?) What size company do you see yourself working in? (Is it a large, small company, or do you see yourself going out on your own?) What are the strengths and challenges do you perceive about that model? What were your biggest takeaways from the course? What have you done this semester as a result of this course to advance your professional development that you hadn’t been doing prior? What, if any, feedback do you have for us on the class? Please also add any thoughts or takeaways that we have not specifically outlined that feel important to you.</p>
