        <h3>AMBIESENSE</h3>
        <p class="desc-box">Design a prototype (product, device, tool, etc.) for a pandemic (past, present, or future). Potential research or problem areas: physical health, telemedicine, social distancing, social connection, mental health, self-care, remote education, pandemic prevention, quarantine solutions, food or resource delivery, humor, therapy, etc.</p>
        <p>AMBIESENSE was designed as a mobile app prototype to help mental health during a pandemic (specifically, when quarantined). It allows individuals to project new and calming atmospheres, allow social interactions, or mimic the feelign of travel without leaving home.</p>

        <p class="desc-box">Create an ATLAS Studio/Lab logotype (the abstracted "A") for your design studio/lab that reflects your interests and career goals. Draw this by hand or design it in a software of your choosing, but your solution should be black and white and resonate with the existing ATLAS Lab branding.</p>
        <p>This lowercase "a" was designed to break the pattern of using only capital letters for ATLAS Labs.</p>

        <h3>Design Challenge 2: Origin Story</h3>
        <p class="desc-box">Write and illustrate a unique origin story. Think about the deeper meanings embedded in the narrative.</p>
        <p>The goal of this origin story was to represent the birth of a hero or villain without the use of words. It uses a minimalist design and over-exaggerated expressions to satirize the stereotypical tragic backstory of many popular characters.</p>

        <h3>Design Challenge 3: Chindogu</h3>
        <p class="desc-box">Design a seemingly useful object that addresses an everyday problem or opportunity. The problem/opportunity must be in your lived environment. You can only use found materials and objects (you cannot spend money on this project) to construct a prototype.</p>
        <p>The designed Chindogu solves two household issues simultaneously: the desire for airflow and cooling, and the entertainment of a cat while left alone.</p>

        <h3>Design Challenge 4: Slowness</h3>
        <p class="desc-box">Design a prototype that encourages mindfulness, meditation, self-awareness, contemplation, etc. The prototype can be digital, analog, or a combination of the two.</p>
        <p>This digital prototype synchronizes a 10-second loop of falling water streams in a calming light environment to promote meditation and lower anxiety.</p>

        <h3>Design Challenge 5: Error</h3>
        <p class="desc-box">Create a prototype that integrates error, or "misuse" in a positive or interesting way. You can make the prototype or it can be a conceptual sketch or drawing.</p>
        <p>The designed prototype interactively shows the proper use of fume hoods through a visual display that responds to the height of the sash. The visual display anthropomorphizes the fume hood via common human facial expressions, providing empathetic feedback for proper and improper use.</p>

        <h3>Design Challenge 6: Drawing Machine</h3>
        <p class="desc-box">Create a machine—analog, digital, or a hybrid of the two—that draws, or allows a user to draw through an unconventional interface.</p>
        <p>This unconventional drawing machine takes in audio (pre-recorded) and visual represents all natural tones each frame in a circular pattern. This allows the visual analysis of different genres and periods of music.</p>

        <h3>Design Challenge 7: Regenerative Design</h3>
        <p class="desc-box">Design and describe a Regenerative Design Process. Regenerative Design is about designing to go beyond sustainability.  Instead of maintaining the status quo, it improves, restores, re-nourishes, and makes better. Think about regenerative braking in a car: we harness and reuse the energy that is typically lost when slowing down a car. Same thing with compost: what was considered waste becomes food, enriching the soil.</p>
        <p>The concept behind my regenerative design is to restore individual energy through a time management system. Allowing interspersed breaks after shorter periods of work (determined for each individual) has been proven to increase productivity during those work periods.</p>

        <p class="desc-box">Create a speculative prop that addresses the following (chosen) scenario: food supply, contopia and far future (100+ years).</p>
        <p>The speculative prop "Supot" represents the extreme effort of sustainably providing nourishment to the world at that cost of losing the language of food.</p>

        <p>The cultural probe "Probe in a Box" was designed not only to gather information of the experience of homeless people during the pandemic, but also to provide assistance and tools for transitioning from homelessness.</p>
